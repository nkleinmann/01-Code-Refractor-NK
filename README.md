## 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Week 1 HW for UNH Bootcamp.  In this project, I focus on making the website as accessible as possible by using semantic elements, adding alt attributes to images, and debugging.  It is crucial to make every website as accessible as possible so that every user can read and enjoy the website.   

Updates to Website:
1. Changed div tags to be header, nav, main, section, article, figure, and footer tags when applicable.
2. Changed large image to be in html instead of css so all images can have an alt attribute.
3. Updated links so that all links are working.
4. Re-organized CSS to follow semantic elements reasoning in HTML.
5. Simplified CSS by eleminating repeats and re-organizing CSS. 

This project was fun to work on! I struggled at first when I started updating the HTML without updating all applicable CSS and had to re-work multiple parts.
